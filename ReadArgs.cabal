Name:                ReadArgs
Version:             1.1
Synopsis:            Simple command line argument parsing

Description:         

  ReadArgs provides the @readArgs@ IO action, which lets you tell the compiler 
  to parse the command line arguments to fit the type signature you give.
  .
  For example @(a :: Int, b :: String, c :: Float) <- readArgs@ would
  parse the first runtime argument as an @Int@, the second as a @String@ (no
  quotes required) and the third as a @Float@.
  .
  If the runtime arguments are incompatible with the type signature,
  then a simple usage statement is given of the types needed.
  .
  Continuing the previous example, if it was used in a
  program named @Example@, the error message for the above
  action would be: 
  .
  @
    usage: Example Int String Float
  @
  .
  Any type that has both @Typeable@ and @Read@ instances
  can be used.  Both @Char@ and @String@ are handled specially so that
  command line arguments for both do not require quotes (as their 
  @Read@ instances do).
  .
  @readArgs@ also supports optional arguments and variadic arguments.
  Optional arguments are specified using @Maybe@, and variadic arguments 
  using a list.  @(a :: Int, b :: Maybe String, c :: [Float]) <- readArgs@ 
  would successfully parse any of the following sets of command line arguments:
  .
  @
    Example 1
    Example 1 2 3 4
    Example 1 foo
    Example 1 foo 2 3 4
  @
  .
  But not
  .
  @
    Example
    Example foo
    Example 1.0
  @
  .
  Usage statements for optional and variadic arguments use command-line
  parlance:
  .
  @
    usage: Example Int [String] [Float..]
  @
  .
  Note that both optional and variadic parsers are greedy by default 
  (so @Example 1 2 3 4@ was parsed as @(1, "2", [3.0,4.0])@.  They
  may both be made non-greedy through use of the @NonGreedy@ constructor:
  .
  @
    ( a :: Int
    , NonGreedy b :: NonGreedy Maybe String
    , NonGreedy c :: NonGreedy [] Float
    ) <- readArgs
  @
